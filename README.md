<h1>Connect4 Bot Project</h1><h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a Connect4 game implementation where a player plays against the bot. The game board is 6x7 and the objective of the game is to connect 4 pieces of the same color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
This project requires `random`, <code>time</code>, <code>sys</code>, and <code>playsound</code> python packages.
<h2>Code Structure</h2>
The code consists of the following modules:
<ul><li>`adam`</li><li><code>ben</code></li><li><code>random</code></li><li><code>time</code></li><li><code>sys</code></li><li><code>playsound</code></li></ul>
The code starts by initializing the game board and then uses the `user_move` function to take player's input on the column where they would like to place their marker. The <code>print_board</code> function is used to display the current state of the board. The <code>place_piece</code> function places the marker on the selected column. <code>make_move</code> function takes the player's marker color and opponent marker color as input and uses the <code>main_funct_name</code> to make a move. The <code>check_for_win</code> function checks if any player has won the game by connecting 4 pieces of the same color. The <code>gb_copy</code> variable is used to make a deep copy of the game board.
<h2>Usage</h2>
To run the Connect4 game, execute the code in a Python environment. The code will prompt the user to enter the column number where they would like to place their marker. The game continues until either the player or the bot wins or all the spots on the board are filled.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This Connect4 bot project provides an implementation of the classic Connect4 game where a player can play against a bot. The code has been structured to handle the game flow and validate user input.
